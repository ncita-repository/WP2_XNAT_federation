# Federated Access with AWS Cognito

Here, you'll find code for implementing OAuth2/OpenID authorisation and authentication.  Provided are applications that act as client and as resource server in the OAuth2 flow (refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/ncita-repository/WP2_XNAT_federation/wiki/Authorisation-and-authentication:-OAuth2-and-OpenID) for an overview of the flow).  In this case, the authorisation server that these applications have been tested with is AWS Cognito.  Here, there is no interaction with XNAT; eventually, the resource server would be replaced by an XNAT instance, or indeed, multiple XNATs at various institutions.  Below is a practical explanation of how to set up each part of the federated access system; refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/ncita-repository/WP2_XNAT_federation/wiki/Federated-access-mechanics) for a more conceptual discussion.
