# WP2_XNAT_federation

### NCITA Repository Unit Work Package 2: XNAT federation

The CRUK NCITA consortium (Cambridge, Institute of Cancer Research, Imperial College, KCL, Manchester, Oxford, UCL) manages a set of XNAT instances. Given the heterogeneous nature of the environments at our respective institutions, we have evolved a variety of XNAT installations. For a number of information governance reasons, it is not appropriate for us to locate all the data on a single XNAT instance, yet it is necessary for selected researchers at the various institutions to collaborate and share data, potentially originating from within repositories that are not routinely accessible from outside networks. This data sharing should be done without the need to export entire datasets to consortium partners or store duplicate copies on XNAT.

WP2 sets out to solve this problem and, in doing so, provide a model for federating XNAT databases in general. Ideally, too, any user interface should be seamless, such that a user authenticated with the service provider should be able to assemble patient cohorts and perform XNAT searches on all data in the federated XNAT system that they have a right to see, regardless of which XNAT instance it sits on. 

The NCITA Repository Unit site as a whole is at an early stage of the life cycle and does not currently have a formal structure of documentation releases. Please bear with us: things will become more organised as the NCITA project gets into gear!
